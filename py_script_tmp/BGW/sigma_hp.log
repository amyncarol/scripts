    n = band index.
  Emf = "inner" mean-field energy eigenvalue used to construct Sigma(E),
        read from WFN_inner.
   Eo = "outer" mean-field energy eigenvalue where we center the evaluation
        frequency grid {E} of Sigma(E). Defaults to Emf, unless
        you use WFN_outer and eqp_outer.dat / scissors_outer.
  Vxc = exchange-correlation pot., calculated from VXC or read from vxc.dat.
    X = bare exchange.
   SX = screened exchange contrib. to Sigma(E) at energy E=Eo
   CH = Coulomb hole contrib. to Sigma(E) at energy E=Eo
  Cor = SX-X + CH = correlation portion of Sigma(E) at energy E=Eo.
  Sig = X + Cor = self energy, Sigma(E), at energy E=Eo.
 Eqp0 = on-shell QP energy = Emf - Vxc + Sig(Eo)
        Eqp0 is *not* the recommended quantity to use for QP properties.
 Eqp1 = off-shell solution to the linearized  Dyson`s equation
      = Eqp0 + (dSig/dE) / (1 - dSig/dE) * (Eqp0 - Eo),
        or a full linear interpolation if more freq. points where computed.
        Eqp1 is the recommended quantity to use for QP properties.
  Znk = quasiparticle renormalization factor

 Notes on the finite_difference_form from sigma.inp file:
   none    : -2 => dSig/dE = 0 (skip the expansion)
   backward: -1 => dSig/dE = (Sig(Eo) - Sig(Eo-dE)) / dE
   central :  0 => dSig/dE = (Sig(Eo+dE) - Sig(Eo-dE)) / (2*dE)
   forward :  1 => dSig/dE = (Sig(Eo+dE) - Sig(Eo)) / dE
   default :  2 => forward for diagonal and none for off-diagonal
   dE is finite_difference_spacing from Sigma.inp file.
   We are using the form #2 with dE = 1.000 eV.

 General notes:
 - All energies are reported here in eV.
 - Both Emf and Vxc contain the average pot. Vxc0, so Vxc0 doesn`t affect Sigma.
 - Eqp1 and Eqp0 are Eqs. (36-37) from Hybertsen & Louie PRB 34 5390.
 - We recommend you use Eqp1 for QP properties of materials.
